# ESC Sound Converter

This project is a [website](https://bastianspringer.eu) to help you transform BlHeli_32 and Bluejay (RTTTL) sounds into each other.

You can also transpose sounds to a lower or higher pitch so that BlHeli_32 and Bluejay are ok with your sounds. Bluejay goes lower, BlHeli_32 goes higher. Search online for your favourite Nokia ringtone using the RTTTL keyword. Bluejay uses the same syntax for the startup sounds as the old Nokia ringtones!

Visit [this page](./vue-readme.md) to get started with developing yourself. Otherwise, feel free to put up an issue if something isn't working as expected or you have a suggestion.
